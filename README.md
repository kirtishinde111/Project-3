A simple Python implementation of the classic Hangman game. The player has to guess a hidden word one letter at a time, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed.

Project Overview
The "Hangman Challenge" is a fun and interactive console-based game where the player guesses letters to reveal a hidden word. The player wins if they guess all the letters correctly before running out of attempts, and they lose if they exhaust their attempts before completing the word.
